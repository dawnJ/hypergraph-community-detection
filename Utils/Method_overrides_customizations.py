    *****!!!sklearn function variation for spectral embeding!!!*****
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Project the sample on the first eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian.

    This embedding can also 'work' even if the ``adjacency`` variable is
    not strictly the adjacency matrix of a graph but more generally
    an affinity or similarity matrix between samples (for instance the
    heat kernel of a euclidean distance matrix or a k-NN matrix).

    However care must taken to always make the affinity matrix symmetric
    so that the eigenvector decomposition works as expected.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_embedding>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    laplacian : array-like or sparse matrix, shape: (n_samples, n_samples)
        The laplacian matrix of the graph to embed.

    n_components : integer, optional, default 8
        The dimension of the projection subspace.

    eigen_solver : {None, 'arpack', 'lobpcg', or 'amg'}, default None
        The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
        to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
        but may also lead to instabilities.

    random_state : int seed, RandomState instance, or None (default)
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
        lobpcg eigenvectors decomposition when eigen_solver == 'amg'.
        By default, arpack is used.

    eigen_tol : float, optional, default=0.0
        Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
        when using arpack eigen_solver.

    drop_first : bool, optional, default=True
        Whether to drop the first eigenvector. For spectral embedding, this
        should be True as the first eigenvector should be constant vector for
        connected graph, but for spectral clustering, this should be kept as
        False to retain the first eigenvector.

    Returns
    -------
    embedding : array, shape=(n_samples, n_components)
        The reduced samples.

    Notes
    -----
    Spectral embedding is most useful when the graph has one connected
    component. If there graph has many components, the first few eigenvectors
    will simply uncover the connected components of the graph.
